## What Are We?
Academic makerspaces are like playgrounds for learning and developing creative skills. We provide the tools and materials, and you provide the ideas! Our makerspace at Berea currently focuses on computational project-- ranging from digital art, to robotics, to e-textiles. We encourage collaborative projects and peer mentoring-- come learn and come share your skills!
Active engagement and event announcements happen on our [Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/bcmakerspace/)
